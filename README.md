# CCC_Solutions
Welcome to my personal CCC Solutions GitHub repository! This is where I've documented my own solutions to problems from the Canadian Computing Competition, all programmed in Python. 

About CCC: The Canadian Computing Competition is an annual programming contest for secondary school students in Canada. It challenges participants with a wide range of computational problems, promoting problem-solving skills and computational thinking.
